# Testing
**It is probably the easiest to simply go through the detailed description in the README in the Project folder!!!**
These sections were written at earlier stages, but still contains some information about how the scripts behave and you can use it for reference for further testing.

**Important to know: When and when not to use the _--local_ option!!**
You can run the scripts from a normal command line with the `--local` option. The script then "connects" to the host (either given by `--src` or `--host` depending on the script) and calls  the script there again.
If you get a terminal with the host via mininet and `xterm <host>`, you should **omit** the `--local` option!

## Prepare Everything
Execute `open_terminals.sh` in the _Project_ folder and follow the dialog (only answer when mininet has started) to get a fast access to test everything.

## test port knocker
This sender first send a sequence of udp knocks as specified in the cli. Then it assumes that the secret port has been activated and sends 10 tcp packets to that secret port. The secret port is set in the file itself. It is 3142.

The current secret port combination is set via the firewall_controller, but to be able to pass the gate, the port_knock_controller needs to listen to activate the secret port... The knocking sequence is set in firewall controller and is currently [100, 101, 102, 103] but can be changed in any way... The only limit is the number of knocks in the sequence due to the bit size of the counter in p4. Can be changed there..

```
sudo python knock_seq_send.py --local --src he2 --dst hi2 -k 100 101 102 103 -s 3142
```
or
```
sudo python knock_seq_send.py --local --src <srcName> --dst <dstName> -k <knock sequence> -s <secret port>
```

## client and server (TCP handshake)
### server
The server script is supposed to run on the `ser` host, but the server can basically run anywhere (from the firewall's view), but the scripts are written towards this use case.
```
sudo python server.py --local --debug
```
The server expects a tcp handshake from a single host and then 'acks' (and prints) the data content that it receives from the host.

### client
The client tries to establish a connection with the server and then sends some data packets. The firewall will reset the first handshake and set the client to the whitelist. The client will simply try again.
After a successful handshake (which it can only do, when it reaches the server) it will send some data packets to the server.

### Bad modes
Both scripts have a 'bad' mode. To activate in both scripts, set the option `--bad`.
For the **client** this means, that he will send only SYN packets after a successful handshake with the server.
For the **server**, this means, that he expects the bad behavior and instead of acking the packets from the client, he will print the received SYNs to show the firewalls funtion. After a while, the firewall should detect this attack, and you should not see the SYN packets anymore on the server side.

## syn flood
The syn flood script iterates through the subnet 10.0.3.0/24 in endless phases from host _he2_ who is in another subnet and therefore spoofs the IPs and just send SYN packets with random source ports. This can be run parallel with the client script to show, that the firewall does not let the bad traffic through, but the client eventually gets through.


# Other scripts
### send and receive
Note: use '--local' option if run from normal CLI and not one started from mininet with `xterm <host>`. Therefore you also have to provide a src, such that the scripts now to which host the must connet first to send the traffic.

Check the `--help` option, but here basically a list of what they can do:
- receive just connects to the host and prints all received packets.
- You can send TCP and UDP packets.
- You can specifiy `i2e` traffic and 'e2i' traffic [default]. Based on this the ports are set to simulate a 'valid' flow between two hosts.
- increase the time between packets with `--sleep`.
- increase the number of packets sent with `-p`.
- print the sent packets also with `--show`, else use at least `--debug` to be not completly silent.
