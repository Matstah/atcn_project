# Controllers
All these scripts can be found at `~/atcn-project/Project/controller` and the commands are expected to be executed from there as in the following documentation.

## firewall_controller.py
This script connects to the firewall and sets 2 blacklists. One that looks at dst ip address for traffic from intern to extern. The other blacklist looks at source ip of traffic from extern to intern. On both lists we use ranges of ip to define what should be blocked. The whitelist is for dst ports from extern to intern traffic. Currently he1 is blocked on both directions, and port 80 and 110 is open.
```
sudo python firewall_controller.py
```
## port_knock_controller.py
The port knock controller sets up a port knocking tracker on the switch via table entries.
It also sets the secret port, which will be opened to a specific source once a correct knocking sequence has been recorded.

Following command uses the default port knocker, with sequence [100,101,102,103], secret port 3141 and time between knocks of 5000000
```
sudo python port_knock_controller.py
```
Specific values can be set with:
```
sudo port_knock_controller.py -ps 100 101 102 103 -s 3143 -t 5000000
```
All UDP traffic, that can not pass the stateful firewall will be dropped by the firewall, independently of this controller.


##syndef_controller.py
TODO

```
sudo python syndef_controller.py
```


## dpi_controller.py
NOTE: DEBUGGING IS NOT WORKING AT THE MOMENT (but still mentioned below)

The script manipulates registers on the firewall, which affects the control flow of the p4 program. If either or both options (DPI and debugging) are used, the p4 program clones the packets and sends them to the controller.
When the script terminates, the register values are reset to disable the functionality on the firewall.

### DPI
This controller can set the probability for which a flow gets selected with the first SYN packet and then log certain flows according to it. For example for a probability of 50%:
```
sudo python dpi_controller.py -p 50
```
sets the probability to 50% by setting the appropriate register on the firewall. From then on the firewall will select with a probability of 50% if a new flow should be monitored. If yes, the firewall will clone the packets of the flow and send them to the controller. The controller then logs the flow in a file of the following format in `./dpi_log`:
```
dpi_<time>_<ip1>and<ip2>-flow<id>_<count>
dpi_1543581262_10.0.1.1and10.0.4.1-flow823_1
```
where one can see the two parties of the communication with `ip1` and `ip2` directly in the filename. The flow id is also shown in the name. The start time ensures, that for a new start of the controller a new file is written. Additionally this gives an immediate hint to the user, when the flow started and the files are ordered by creation time inherently. The id at the end shows if the flow timed out in the mean time and a new flow with the same parties was created. A high number therefore indicates that lots of flows with the external host were created.
Separate files per flow also gives the ability to follow a inspected flow live with:
```
tail -f dpi_log/dpi_1543581262_10.0.1.1and10.0.4.1-flow823_1
```

### Debugging functionality
NOTE: NOT WORKING AT THE MOMENT
Additionally, the DPI functionality can be abused for debugging. If the controller is started as
```
sudo dpi_controller.py -d
```
no files are logged, but all packets are cloned by the firewall and the controller prints the contents directly in the command line.

The two functionalities can be started together, where still only certain flows are logged according to the provided probability, but all packages regardless are printed. For example:
```
sudo dpi_controller.py -p 20 -d
```
